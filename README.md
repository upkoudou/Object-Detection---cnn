# Object recognition 

Hello guys, 

I know we all had difficutlies to implement DL tools, to use them or even  to understand them, BUT that will
no longer be the case because scientists, researchers & devloppers are working together to make everybody happy.

I have a serie on Medium https://medium.com/data-science-demystified , helping everyone to understand data science tools, goals and all the big buzz words arround the topic.

For now we will focus on Object recognition, which a subset of Computer vision (I am a fan).
